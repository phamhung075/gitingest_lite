Additionally, prices dropped faster for ores and minerals (-3.0% vs. -2.7%) and food products, beverages, tobacco, and textiles (-0.4% vs. -0.1%).

It marked the highest reading since August 2023, with food and beverage prices rising 0.3% in November after being flat in October, while prices for miscellaneous personal goods accelerated (2.7% vs 2.3%). Prices continued to rise for housing and utilities (9.1% vs 9.6% in October), driven by higher rents for housing (10.8% vs 11.6%), and for restaurants & hotels (1.5% vs 1.9%). At the same time, transport prices fell, but at a slower pace (-2.5% vs -3.1%). On a monthly basis, the CPI rose by 0.3%, above market forecasts of a 0.2% gain. This maintained the same pace as the previous month and remained at the highest level in six months."

Wang said there is room to further reduce the RRR from the current average level of 6.6%. Friday's data showed that China\u2019s banks extended CNY 580 billion in new yuan loans in November 2024, well below the market expectation of CNY 950 billion, and less than half of the CNY 1.170 trillion from the corresponding period of the previous year, highlighting weak credit demand in the mainland. Last Thursday, China said it would raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and loosen monetary policy to maintain a stable economic growth rate. As Reuters reported, China's economy is expected to grow by about 5% this year, citing Han Wenxiu, the deputy director of the country's central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission."

The figures exclude sales from BMW, Mercedes, JLR, and Volvo. This marked the second consecutive month of growth in passenger vehicle sales, driven by major festivals, even though the Diwali festival did not fall in the month of November. \u201cThe demand momentum seen in October during the festive period has continued into November for the industry as a whole,\" said Rajesh Menon, Director General of SIAM. On a monthly basis, car sales plunged by 12.9% in November, reversing a 9.3% jump in the previous month, as the two major festivals, Dussehra and Diwali, both occurred in October."

About 11.0% of the total, or CNY 82.53 billion, went into high-tech manufacturing industries. Despite the persistent weakness in FDI, it soared for medical equipment and instrument manufacturing (53.4%), computer and office equipment (39.1%), and professional technical services (19%). The primary sources of FDI were Germany (10.9%), Singapore (4.8%), and Switzerland (4.0%). In recent years, Beijing has tightened regulations across various industries to enforce government policies, discouraging foreign investment. For November alone, CNY 56.49 billion flowed into the country, up from CNY 52.61 billion in October."

Standard & Poor's credit rating for France stands at AA- with stable outlook. DBRS' credit rating for France was last reported at AA (high) with stable outlook."

Despite stronger-than-expected economic activity at the start of Q4, evidenced by the 0.1% growth in the IBC-Br index for October, concerns persist over Brazil's fiscal outlook and the potential impact of restrictive monetary policy. While economic indicators such as retail and service sectr performance signal resilience, expectations for 2025 point to a slowdown amid tighter monetary and fiscal conditions and a labor market with limited room for further gains. Mega-cap miner Vale shed 1.7%, while big banks Banco Santander, Banco do Brasil, Ita\u00fasa, and Bradesco posted losses ranging from 0.4% to 1.3%. Meanwhile, healthcare leaders Rede D'Or and Raia Drogasil led the decline with sharp losses of 2.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The Ibovespa posted a weekly loss of 1.1%."

Oil-linked heavyweights Suncor, Imperial Oil, and Canadian Natural also underperformed, shedding between 0.5% and 1.1%, despite higher oil prices. Earlier in the week, the TSX was weighed down by BoC Governor Tiff Macklem's hawkish remarks, signaling that future rate cuts would be more gradual following the recent 50 bps reduction."

The Dow, however, dropped 86 points, extending its losing streak to seven sessions, marking its longest stretch since 2020.

Broadcom surged 24.4%, hitting a $1 trillion market cap after reporting a 220% increase in AI-related revenue, exceeding expectations.

The broader market showed mixed performance, with concerns over the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy decision and economic conditions limiting further gains. For the week, the S&P 500 was on track for a 0.7% decline, the Dow for a 1.8% drop, while the Nasdaq managed a 0.3% gain, reflecting broader economic uncertainty."

Meanwhile, employment in the services industry declined slightly, reflecting a cautious business environment marked by layoffs and hiring freezes amid an uncertain outlook. On the pricing front, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the fastest pace since April, while output charges climbed at the sharpest rate since February. Looking ahead, business expectations for future output edged higher from September\u2019s recent low but remained below the long-term average."

Also, employment retreated and there was a further pick-up in inflationary pressures. Finally, although expectations for output in the coming year ticked up further from September\u2019s recent low, they remained weaker than the long-run average as firms voiced concerns about political uncertainty, a sluggish economy and troubles in the automotive sector.

This marked the 41st consecutive month of growth in services activity and the fastest pace since August, driven by a continued improvement in demand, as seen from a sharp increase in new orders, the most significant since July. Subsequently, service providers experienced a notable rise in job creation, with overall employment growth reaching survey highs. Firms continued to expand their workforce in response to rising backlogs and new business opportunities. On the pricing front, a moderation in cost pressures helped ease charge inflation. Overall, business optimism among private sector companies strengthened for the second consecutive month, reaching its highest level since September 2023, as both manufacturers and service firms became more upbeat about the future outlook."

However, finished goods stocks contracted as companies drew from warehouses to meet rising demand. Meanwhile, manufacturers adopted more aggressive pricing.

Now, the Constitutional Court has 180 days to decide whether to uphold President Yoon's impeachment or allow him to return to office. If the impeachment is upheld, a new presidential election must be held within 60 days."

It marked the fastest pace in NODX since August, mainly due to a jump in electronic product sales. Electronic product shipments surged by 23.2%, accelerating sharply from a 2.6% gain in October, boosted by integrated circuits (28.9%), disk media products (114.7%), and other computer peripherals (75.3%). Non-electronic shipments fell 1.6%, moderating from a 6.8% gain in October, weighed by paper & paperboard (-89.9%), pharmaceuticals (-63.8%), and petrochemicals (-5.3%). Exports rose mainly to Taiwan (42.7%), Hong Kong (35.3%), and South Korea (32.6%) while declining to the US (-19.1%), Japan (-12.1%), and China (-11.6%). On a monthly basis, NODX jumped 14.7%, the first increase in four months, rebounding sharply from the steepest decline in seven months of an upwardly revised 7.5% plunge in October."

The index took cues from Wall Street, where technology stocks delivered strong performance, bolstering investor sentiment. In addition, market participants are bracing for an expected interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve later this week, with much of the focus shifting to the Fed's outlook for 2025. Domestically, however, Australian consumer confidence showed signs of strain, with December data revealing a decline as consumers turned more pessimistic about the economic outlook. Despite this, heavyweight bank stocks led the market's advance. Commonwealth Bank rose 1.6%, ANZ Group gained 0.8%, National Australia Bank increased 1.5%, and Macquarie Group was up 1%. In contrast, mining and energy stocks were more mixed, reflecting weaker commodity prices amid broader global economic uncertainty."

Both sub-indexes retraced approximately half of the gains made in the previous two months. Several factors likely contributed to this shift in sentiment, including a disappointing GDP update in Q3, inflationary concerns, and rate cut uncertainties. Despite this overall decline, consumers reported continued improvements in \"current conditions,\" which assess financial well-being compared to a year ago and whether it is a good time to purchase major household items."

        "content": "Aluminum Falls to 1-Month Low Commodity Aluminum futures fell to $2,570 per tonne in December, their lowest in one month, and in line with the broad pressure for industrial metals in major exchanges this month as ample supply for the metal magnified the impact of uncertain demand. New data showed that the output of primary aluminum in China rose by 3.6% from the previous year in November. This matched stronger supply earlier in the year as rainfall in the production hub of Yunnan supported the creation of hydropower for smelters. In turn, Beijing\u2019s willingness to let the yuan devalue drove prices for base metals with Chinese manufacturing hubs to pull back in dollar-denominated exchanges. This balanced against soaring alumina prices due to supply disruptions and Beijing\u2019s decision to end tax rebates on exports of semi-manufactured aluminum products in December, removing around five million tonnes of supply from the international market, according to market players\u2019 estimates."

The initial decline was likely driven by profit-taking and weaker-than-expected economic data from China, including disappointing retail sales figures. However, expectations of tighter supplies, spurred by additional sanctions on major producers Russia and Iran, helped limit losses. Market participants are also looking ahead to the Fed\u2019s policy decision later this week, with another 25bps rate cut anticipated. Such a move could support economic growth and, in turn, boost oil demand.

The development took place as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, with slowing demand driving power-intensive industries to cut back on output. Increasing concerns that stimulus from Beijing will not be able to trigger growth maintained the bearish pressure on thermal coal prices.

This marks the fifth consecutive rate cut this year, bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level since April 2022. The move is aimed at balancing inflationary and external account pressures while fostering sustainable economic growth. Pakistan's inflation rate fell to 4.9% in November, the lowest since April 2018, driven by a continued decline in food prices and the waning impact of gas tariff hikes from November 2023. However, core inflation remained elevated at 9.7%. Policymakers also noted a modest improvement in the country\u2019s growth outlook."

Earlier this week, data showed that retail sales growth in November slowed more than expected, reflecting weaker consumption. Meanwhile, new home prices dropped for the 17th consecutive month, signaling continued challenges in the property sector. On a more positive note, industrial production growth surpassed forecasts last month. Investors are now looking ahead to the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s loan prime rate decisions later this week for potential clues on future policy moves. Among individual stocks, notable losses were seen in Hytera Communication (-6.6%), Guangdong Advance (-6.5%), Offcn Education (-3.3%), Sunwave Commuinication (-10%), and Leyard Optoelectronic (-13.4%)."

Sluggish activity data for November in China continued to weigh on sentiment, with retail sales growth unexpectedly slowing while industrial output rose at a relatively similar pace to October. Markets lingered at their lowest level in over a week, as cautious traders anticipated interest rate decisions from major central banks, including the US Fed, this week. A monthly review of key lending rates in China will also take place in the coming days, following the PBoC's move to retain them at record lows in November. Helping to limit the decline were signs that Beijing will stick with its plan to stimulate consumption next year, despite avoiding massive fiscal stimulus. Early decliners included Techtronic Inds. (-2.7%), JD Logistics (-2.6%), Wuxi Biologics (-2.2%), Sino Land Co. (-1.6%), and Xiaomi Corp. (-1.2%)."

The outlook of muted demand from China drove the IEA to forecast that the global oil market will remain in a surplus next year, even though OPEC+ members have agreed to delay production hikes. The UAE was the latest to manifest its reluctance to phase out supply cuts by reducing oil shipments next year.

Meanwhile, traders assessed a batch of economic data from major economies, including PMI surveys. On the domestic front, PMI data showed the UK experienced the fastest decline in private sector employment for nearly four years in December, despite a marginal upturn in output following the payroll tax hike in the new Labour budget. Among individual stocks, Entertain was the biggest loser, falling 6.2% after Australia\u2019s financial crime regulator launched civil penalty proceedings against it. Centrica dropped 3.1% after confirming its chair, Scott Wheway, would step down and be replaced by Kevin O'Byrne. BP, Endeavour Mining, and Croda International also lost ground. Meanwhile, Rolls-Royce, 3I Group PLC, Bunzl, and International Consolidated Airlines Group were among the top performers."

New data showed that the output of primary aluminum in China rose by 3.6% from the previous year in November. This matched stronger supply earlier in the year as rainfall in the production hub of Yunnan supported the creation of hydropower for smelters. In turn, Beijing\u2019s willingness to let the yuan devalue drove prices for base metals with Chinese manufacturing hubs to pull back in dollar-denominated exchanges. This balanced against soaring alumina prices due to supply disruptions and Beijing\u2019s decision to end tax rebates on exports of semi-manufactured aluminum products in December, removing around five million tonnes of supply from the international market, according to market players\u2019 estimates."

The development took place as utilities already deal with record-high coal inventories, with slowing demand driving power-intensive industries to cut back on output. Increasing concerns that stimulus from Beijing will not be able to trigger growth maintained the bearish pressure on thermal coal prices.

However, the upward momentum was limited by persistent concerns over Brazil's fiscal and monetary outlook. Investors remain skeptical about the government's fiscal credibility and the Central Bank's future stance, particularly with a new board set to take office in January. Doubts linger over the prioritization of the inflation target, exacerbated by government criticism of recent monetary policy decisions. The fiscal package, deemed insufficient to stabilize public debt, has further fueled worries of an unsustainable debt-to-GDP trajectory."

On a monthly basis, food prices inched down by 0.1% in November, following a 0.9% drop in a month earlier. The largest contributor to the fall was vegetables, down 7.9%. This was partly offset by a rise in fruit prices, up 4%."

A sharper contraction in manufacturing activity in the island nation for November rattled market sentiment, coupled with caution ahead of New Zealand's food inflation data later in the day. In key trade partner China, November's activity figures, including industrial output, retail sales, and the surveyed jobless rate, are also expected. Optimism that the US Fed will deliver another 25bps rate cut in its final meeting of the year on Wednesday helped to cap further declines. Meanwhile, the Chinese central bank is projected to maintain its benchmark key lending rates at record lows this week to aid the sluggish economy.\nAmong early laggards were Manawa Energy Ltd. (-1.8%), South Port NZ (-1.6%), Auckland International Airport (-1.3%), and Briscoe Group (-1.1%)."

OPTIONS and HEAD methods are actually part of the HTTP specification but not typically used in RESTful API route definitions. They are handled automatically by most web servers and frameworks for:

OPTIONS: Used for CORS preflight requests
HEAD: Automatically handled version of GET that returns only headers

So in your RESTful API route definitions, you should only use:

GET: For retrieving resources
POST: For creating new resources
PUT: For complete update/replacement of a resource
PATCH: For partial update of a resource
DELETE: For removing resources
